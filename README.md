# Hotel Management System

## Project Background
With the increasing complexity of hotel operations, information systems are widely used
to improve efficiency in room management, customer registration, and billing processes.
This project implements a hotel management system that integrates core business functions
into a unified software system.

The project focuses on **system design, data organization, and functional correctness**,
aiming to provide a practical example of applying software engineering principles to a
realistic management scenario.

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Hotel Management System** that supports basic hotel operations,
including room management, customer information management, and check-in/check-out workflows.

The system was developed as part of a **software engineering–related project**, emphasizing
clear module structure, data consistency, and maintainability.

## System Features
- Room information management (room type, availability, status)
- Customer registration and information storage
- Check-in and check-out operations
- Basic billing and record management
- Console-based or GUI-based interaction (depending on implementation)

---

## System Design

### Architecture
The system adopts a modular design, separating:
- data models,
- business logic,
- user interaction components.

This structure improves code readability and facilitates future extension.

### Data Management
- Structured storage of room and customer information
- Clear data access and update logic to ensure consistency

## Implementation Details
- Programming Language: *(e.g., Java / C++ / Python — modify if needed)*
- Development Focus:
  - Object-oriented design
  - Modular implementation
  - Clear control flow and error handling
